had to limit myself to using IC packages with extended leads due to lack of a way to 
soldering them, I decided on building a Solder Reflow Oven 2.0 !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first version was built around an AT90USB646, it worked fine but it used a separate
12V dc adapter to power the board. This time around I wanted to power the board and the
reflow oven from the mains and also add some TFT LCD tech to make it more rad!! Well, 
thats all the motivation/excuse I needed to build Solder Reflow Oven 2.0&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="PID Control System"></category></entry></feed>
